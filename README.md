# Bomberman-Game
Bomberman Game (Link Minesweeper)

Problem Statement: 

The rules for the game are simple:

You have a 9*9 grid which makes a total of 81 boxes.
Out of these 81 boxes 10 boxes contain bomb and other boxes are normal.
If a normal box is clicked, the user is awarded a point and if a user clicks on a
box containing a bomb, the game gets over (GAME OVER!) and you need to
give an option to the user to start a fresh game.

Whenever a user clicks on a cell he/she should be able to see a number based on the following conditions:
Consider a rectangular area around the cell clicked.

 - Calculate the number of bombs contained in that area.

 - Display the number in the cell.

Users first! üôè
You have helped users a lot by guiding them the path, but what if they could remember their conclusions out of those helping paths?
For example: The user is sure that some cell contains a bomb, they may want to remember it so that they don't have to make calculations again and again.

Give the users an option to flag a cell as follows:

When users right-clicks on a cell they should see something like a flag.
This way users can remember that they concluded there's a bomb in that cell and should not click it. If a user left-clicks on this flagged cell, normal flow should continue.

Time for celebration üéâ
If a user has scored 71 points it means he has clicked all the safe cells. A message should be displayed on the screen saying "CONGRATULATIONS! You have won the game"

Along with this message should be a play again button. Keep users engaged!
